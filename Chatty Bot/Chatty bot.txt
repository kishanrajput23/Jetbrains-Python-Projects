Description:-
At the final stage, you will improve your simple bot so that it can give you a test and check your answers.
The test should be a multiple-choice quiz about programming.
Your bot has to repeat the test until you answer correctly and congratulate you upon completion.

Objective:-
Your bot can ask anything you want, but there are two rules for your output:

1. the line with the test should end with the question mark character;
2. an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.)
3. If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message:
Please, try again.
The program should stop on the correct answer and print Congratulations, have a nice day! at the end.

CODE:-

print('Hello! My name is Aid.')
print('I was created in 2020.')
print('Please, remind me your name.')

name = input()

print('What a great name you have, ' + name + '!')
print('Let me guess your age.')
print('Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.')

rem3 = int(input())
rem5 = int(input())
rem7 = int(input())

age = (rem3 * 70 + rem5 * 21 + rem7 * 15) % 105

print("Your age is " + str(age) + "; that's a good time to start programming!")
print('Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.')

# read a number and count to it here

n = int(input())
i = 0
while i < n+1:   
    print(i, '!')
    i += 1
print("Let's test your programming knowledge.")
print("Why do we use methods?")
answer = input("1. To repeat a statement multiple times.\n2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.\n3. To determine the execution time of a program.\n4. To interrupt the execution of a program.:")
if answer.lower() == "2":
    print('Completed, have a nice day!')
else:
    print("Please, try again.")
print("Congratulations, have a nice day!")
